# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
# On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).
# Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to
# reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

# Example 1:
# Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].

# cost[i]: 第i阶最少的累积的cost是多少
# transition: cost[i] += min(cost[i-1], cost[i-2])
